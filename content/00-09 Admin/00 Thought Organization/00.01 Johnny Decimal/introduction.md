My notes and the structure of these thoughts are organized using the [Johnny Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com/) system. It's a simple numeric system created by [Johnny Noble](https://johnnydecimal.com/00-09-site-administration/01-about/01.01-colophon/)to help organize your files/folders that can organically expand.

I recommend reading the [Introduction](https://johnnydecimal.com/10-19-concepts/11-core/11.01-introduction/)to learn more and better understand the `XX.YY` numbers system you see on these documents.
